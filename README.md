# Food - c02
##### See how much c02 your food consumption emits

### Description
This food app is an awareness app that quickly shows you how much c02 emission your food product produces: this is done by the three colours **green, yellow** and **red**. The app also allows you to browse through recipe ideas. 

The app is divided intwo two sections: inform and inspire.
As suggested, the inform section will give you the amount of c02 emission per kg product, illustrated in c02 bubbles and number of km. In case there is more than one option, namely conventional and organic, it will show you the two, giving the consumer enough information to make a more sustainable decision. The inspire section will give you several recipes that include the product and will redirect you to the recipe.

### Background
Food-c02 was a group effort created during the New York Code and Design Academy's JavaScript intensive web development programme, which is a 12-week intensive course. This project was done in collaboration with two UI/UX students from another course, who provided @ernagoudt and I with the design and app idea. The app utilizes concepts learned throughout the programme.

For the c02 data we used an Xcel document, which we imported in a PostgreSQL database. As for the recipes, we used the Recipe Puppy API.
